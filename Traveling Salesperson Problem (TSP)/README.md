# Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) Project, Idaho State University

The TSP problem consists of Given: a directed graph and a cost associated with each edge; Return: the lowest cost complete simple tour of the graph. This project implemented a graphical user interface and multiple algorithms, including the Branch and bound, the Greedy, and the Hungarian, aimed to find best solutions for the TSP in Python. The project report contains an explanation of each algorithm, an empirical analysis of the results, and screenshots of the operation. As a group member, I completed the Hungarian algorithm, the graphical user interface, and the final project report.
