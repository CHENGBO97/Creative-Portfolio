# Internet Relay Chat (IRC) Project, Idaho State University

In this project, I used the programming language C to implement broadcasting messages to several clients according to channels the client subscribed to. Not only did I implement multiple commands to support usersâ€™ experience, but I also built support for threaded file I/O including for logging and reading in and updating configuration files. In addition to the code, I also provided a detailed project description, README file of how to run the code, and screenshots of the program running. The whole project was completed by myself.
