## [Dream Delivery](https://youtu.be/BNJlZh9nY9Y)

Dream Delivery is a single-player VR game made with Unity. Player needs to complete training in order to get qualified to deliver dreams in three locations, from easy medium to difficult levels. Using controllers to grab materials and using strategy to place objects to build roads. Explore, think, and interact. Here is the [APK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d8EhvFmLKjJOWGNE6atw-OjlqPQzvAMd/view?usp=sharing) for the game.

## [Home Sick](https://youtu.be/ED0K1INgyp8)

Due to the pandemic, it has become difficult for Chinese students studying abroad to back to China. Hometown has become an unreachable place for us, just like the left and right hands in this clock are hard to meet. . .

The right hand (Chinese student) represents the minute hand, moving one toward the center every ten minutes, for a total of 6 steps, one hour. The left hand (Chinese family) represents the hour hand, moving one square to the center every hour, for a total of 12 steps. So every time after the last 12 hours the right hand and left hand can meet in the middle.

The mask suspended in the middle is the subject of this project, representing the fact that it is difficult for Chinese students and their families to meet each other because of it.

I used Unity to simulate the effect of the elastic rope, and made a four-sided holographic with w= 30" h= 23" d= 18". In November 2022, I was selected to participate in the NYU ITP Winter Show for display.

## [Virtual Gallery](https://youtu.be/oHbZ_ncd9P8)

Nowadays, photography does not only stand for an image shot by a camera. For fashion photographers, I believe new and innovative visual impacts are always attractive to them. Especially in fashion photography, more and more ‚Äúphoto works‚Äù are created by many new technologies and used for commercial or independent artworks. 

In this project, I wish there was a space for these new media arts to have a new way for people to be into a photo work in this gallery. So I built a gallery space in unity. There will be a showcase of three photo works in the gallery. I created a space for each of these photos for the interaction part. In the whole experience, the player will experience it from a first-person view. [Watch it on YouTube](https://youtu.be/oHbZ_ncd9P8).

## [Disco Universe Adventure](https://chengbo.itch.io/disco-universe-adventure)

In this game, the character keeps running forward. You just need to jump, squat, and shoot to avoid the claws on your way till you reach the finish line! The game will record the time you used. Let‚Äôs see how fast you can get to the finish line!! [Watch it on YouTube](https://youtu.be/G1N6K8c0MdA), [Play it on itch.io](https://chengbo.itch.io/disco-universe-adventure).

Actually, I also made a physical controller for this game. Combined with Pressure Sensor/Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) and Arduino Nano 33 IoT Board, users can achieve clapping (Attack). Combined with IMU Sensor and Arduino Nano 33 BLE Board, used TinyML to learn and detect two motions (Jump, Squat). [Watch it on YouTube](https://youtu.be/9fbt-A-QG5g).

## [Cornell Box](https://chengbo.itch.io/cornell-box)

This box contains three layers. From top to bottom, they are the lava layer containing dragons, the ocean layer containing fish, and the garden layer containing flowers. The player will land from a high altitude through the first angle of view, and the direction of the angle of view can be controlled by the keyboard and mouse.

My idea for creating this box is that I want to use strong color contrasts and extremely unrealistic things in the environment to make the player feel a strange crossing when passing through different spaces.
