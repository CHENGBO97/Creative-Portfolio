# [Virtual Gallery](https://youtu.be/oHbZ_ncd9P8)

Nowadays, photography does not only stand for an image shot by a camera. For fashion photographers, I believe new and innovative visual impacts are always attractive to them. Especially in fashion photography, more and more ‚Äúphoto works‚Äù are created by many new technologies and used for commercial or independent artworks. 

In this project, I wish there was a space for these new media arts to have a new way for people to be into a photo work in this gallery. So I built a gallery space in unity. There will be a showcase of three photo works in the gallery. I created a space for each of these photos for the interaction part. In the whole experience, the player will experience it from a first-person view. [Watch it on YouTube](https://youtu.be/oHbZ_ncd9P8).

# [Disco Universe Adventure](https://chengbo.itch.io/disco-universe-adventure)

In this game, the character keeps running forward. You just need to jump, squat, and shoot to avoid the claws on your way till you reach the finish line! The game will record the time you used. Let‚Äôs see how fast you can get to the finish line!! [Watch it on YouTube](https://youtu.be/G1N6K8c0MdA), [Play it on itch.io](https://chengbo.itch.io/disco-universe-adventure).

Actually, I also made a physical controller for this game. Combined with Pressure Sensor/Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) and Arduino Nano 33 IoT Board, users can achieve clapping (Attack). Combined with IMU Sensor and Arduino Nano 33 BLE Board, used TinyML to learn and detect two motions (Jump, Squat). [Watch it on YouTube](https://youtu.be/9fbt-A-QG5g).

# [Eye of The Universe](https://chengbo.itch.io/ff-week6)

# [Cornell Box](https://chengbo.itch.io/cornell-box)

This box contains three layers. From top to bottom, they are the lava layer containing dragons, the ocean layer containing fish, and the garden layer containing flowers. The player will land from a high altitude through the first angle of view, and the direction of the angle of view can be controlled by the keyboard and mouse.

My idea for creating this box is that I want to use strong color contrasts and extremely unrealistic things in the environment to make the player feel a strange crossing when passing through different spaces.
