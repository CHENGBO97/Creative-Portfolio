# [CHENGBO XING](https://chengbo.cargo.site/)

A graduate student in the Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) at New York University. Come from a computer science background, proficient in Python and Java programming languages. Passionate about creating diverse projects with Unity & Cinema 4D, and currently exploring the infinite possibilities of VR. I am a fashion model as well ;)

# [Unity Projects, New York University](https://github.com/CHENGBO97/Creative-Portfolio/tree/main/Unity%20Games)

These works are all from my school project. I am still learning and exploring the possibilities of unity in game creation. The imaginative scenography is my favorite part. [Watch the Video Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqMMhriyYMRvqBNotfsnvjUl75_hmZJnD).

# [Cinema 4D, New York University](https://github.com/CHENGBO97/Creative-Portfolio/tree/main/Cinema%204D)

These works are also from my school project, and most of them are just my whimsical creations. I'm still working on them to make them more complete. [Website](https://chengbo-xing.webflow.io/), [Watch the Video Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqMMhriyYMRujak8lRcK3GNDh3nCfyOg7).

# [Acquire Project, Idaho State University](https://github.com/ChengboXXing/Creative-Portfolio/tree/main/Acquire%20Project)

This is a digital version of the Acquire board game in Java as a group project. Acquire is a multi-player mergers and acquisitions themed board game. The object of the game is to earn the most money by developing and merging hotel chains. Not only this project contains the main modules such as Board, Driver, Chain, and Tile, etc., but also a graphical user interface made with JavaFX. I provided the code and a screenshot of the running game interface. As a team developer, I completed all the UI parts and code testing.

# [Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) Project, Idaho State University](https://github.com/ChengboXXing/Creative-Portfolio/tree/main/Traveling%20Salesperson%20Problem%20(TSP))

The TSP problem consists of Given: a directed graph and a cost associated with each edge; Return: the lowest cost complete simple tour of the graph. This project implemented a graphical user interface and multiple algorithms, including the Branch and bound, the Greedy, and the Hungarian, aimed to find best solutions for the TSP in Python. The project report contains an explanation of each algorithm, an empirical analysis of the results, and screenshots of the operation. As a group member, I completed the Hungarian algorithm, the graphical user interface, and the final project report.

# [Internet Relay Chat (IRC) Project, Idaho State University](https://github.com/ChengboXXing/Creative-Portfolio/tree/main/Internet%20Relay%20Chat%20(IRC))

In this project, I used the programming language C to implement broadcasting messages to several clients according to channels the client subscribed to. Not only did I implement multiple commands to support users’ experience, but I also built support for threaded file I/O including for logging and reading in and updating configuration files. In addition to the code, I also provided a detailed project description, README file of how to run the code, and screenshots of the program running. The whole project was completed by myself.

# [Monopoly Project, Idaho State University](https://github.com/ChengboXXing/Creative-Portfolio/tree/main/Monopoly%20Project)

This is a digital version of the Monopoly board game in Java as a group project. It contains seven main modules, such as Players, Board and Game Engine, etc. This project has a graphical user interface, responding to both mouse and keyboard input, which attempts to mimic the play of the actual game. I simply showed all the operations of the game in a demo video. As the group leader, I completed the graphical user interface, Board, and MainGame, etc. [Monopoly Demo YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/66xGHN_pJ4o)

# Assistive Tableware Set, Henan University of Economics and Law

In China, I joined Enactus, an international organization, which focuses on using business skills to solve social problems. My team created a set of specially designed assistive tableware for the elderly in nursing homes, which was more conducive to people with physical impairments. The tableware set includes a bowl with an inclined angle, a spoon with a curvature, a cup with increased friction at the bottom, and a chopstick with a link device at the end. As the team leader, I was responsible for the research of the entire project and participated in the main design of the product. This set of tableware was made in China a long time ago, and now the data has been lost, so I apologize for not being able to provide any graphics.
